Overview: This is a 4 week unit zero, basic skills, for a 7th grade Introduction to Computer Science course.  It will give an overview of the following topics:  history/evolution of computers;  computing languages; how computers work:  hardware, software, memory, processing;  universal programming concepts and keyboarding and shortcuts .  The purpose is to provide students with foundational skills for a middle school computer science class because there is a disconnect between students and past and present technology and how we got here. Also, students have various exposures to computer education so this unit will help to build background knowledge.
